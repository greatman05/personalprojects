Things I create when I am inspired to code

This will be a general repository which will show that I got my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Wayne State University legitmately.

I know Python, C++, HTML, CSS3, and Javascript.

I am familiar with C# and MySQL.

I know next-to-nothing about everything else beyond having the ability to translate what I read into C++ code.

My business website for my business, The I.T. General, LLC, located at 4612 24th St, Detroit, MI, 48208 is https://www.theitgeneral.com

I have used my degree in IT Support jobs to transform the job into a DevOps position while getting paid the exact same as an IT Support person.

I like people. I like Computers. I like both.
